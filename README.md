# Discord-Tools
A Discord Tool, to Generate Nitro 

# About Discord-Tools
This tool was supposed to have lots of functionalities inside, But the project has been canceled.
By the way, it only has Nitro Generator that creates random codes and check them through Discord API.
This tool also has proxy-chaining technology to avoid limitations. If you need to have higher speeds, you need to update proxy list config folder
